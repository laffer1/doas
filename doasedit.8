.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens an editor on a temporary copy of a
text file. Once the file has been altered, it is written
back to the original location, using doas for elevated access.
This is intended for use in editing configuration files where
the user may need to be root to edit a file, but does not wish
to run their text editor as the super user.
.Pp
The doasedit utility accepts one argument, the file to
be edited. The text editor used during the editing process
is set using the VISUAL environment variable. If VISUAL fails
to run, EDITOR is tried instead.
